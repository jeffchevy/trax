Stewart Museum Foundation with the consent and cooperation of the Boy Scouts of America, Penn\'s Woods Council and the family of James M. Stewart. The purpose of this award is to introduce Boy Scouts to the life of a great American, James Maitland Stewart. The Jimmy Stewart Museum is offering this award to a Boy Scout or Scouter who has exemplified the characteristics necessary to live the life of a Good Citizen. To earn the award, Scouts are required to complete the Jimmy Stewart Museum quiz, write an essay of not less than 500 words, and do a good citizenship project in their community in honor of James M. Stewart.\n\nInterested Scouts or Scouters should contact The Jimmy Stewart Museum to receive a copy of the workbook. The price of the workbook is $6.00 which includes shipping. Scouts can send a check in that amount to:\n\nThe Jimmy Stewart Museum\nP. O. Box 1\nIndiana PA 15701\n\nOnce the required work has been done, the application form from the workbook, the quiz and the 500 word essay should be sent to the Museum. The patch and /or medal will then be sent. The price of the patch is $4.00, and the medal is $7.50. Please add $1.00 for each item ordered to cover shipping. Again, a check may be sent to the Museum.\n\nJimmy Stewart was born in Indiana, PA and grew up with a background in scouting. He remained involved with scouting throughout his adult life. It is hoped that the values of the Boy Scouts that were shared by Jimmy Stewart will become ingrained in each recipient of The James M. Stewart Good Citizenship Award.', '156', '');

The Scout or Scouter is compared to a photo of his or her starting posture, noting 13 different body segments. Each body segment is scored as a five, three, or one, making a possible range of scores from 13 to 65. Higher scores over time reflect improving posture.\nAccuracy: The target throw is used to measure accuracy. The Scout or Scouter makes 20 throws with a softball at a circular target and is scored on the number of times the target is hit.\nStrength: The sit-up is used to measure strength. The Scout or Scouter lies on his or her back with knees bent and feet on the floor. The arms are crossed on the chest with the hands on the opposite shoulders. The feet are held by a partner to keep them on the floor. Curl to the sitting position until the elbows touch the thighs. Arms must remain on the chest and chin tucked on the chest. Return to the starting position, shoulder blades touching the floor. The score is the number of sit-ups made in a given time.\nAgility: The side step is used to measure agility. Starting from a center line, the Scout or Scouter sidesteps alternately left and right between two lines 8 feet apart. He or she is scored on the number of lines crossed in 10 seconds.\nSpeed: The dash is used to measure speed. The score is the amount of time to the nearest half-second running a set distance that can be increased each year.\nBalance: The squat stand is used to measure balance. The Scout or Scouter squats with hands on the floor and elbows against the inner knee. He or she leans forward until the feet are raised off the floor. The score is the number of seconds held in that position.\nEndurance: The squat thrust is used to measure endurance. The Scout or Scouter starts from the standing position. He or she performs the usual four-position exercise. The score is the number of completed squat thrusts made in a given time.\n\nSome of these tests measure more than the components they represent. For example, the sit-ups, a measure of strength, also reflect some endurance because of their repetition. The squat stand requires balance, its major component, but also requires strength and endurance to support the weight of the body on the arms.\n\n\nRequirements:', '165', '');

In 1956, however, the BSA decided that Scouts and Scouters that participate in an approved \'international activity or event\' would wear the Crest to and from that event as members of other nations would be doing. The following year, 1957, the BSA made the World Crest available to local Councils (it was previously only avaialbe from the BSA\'s International Service), and established the requirements which lasted until 1991: \'take part in an organized international activity or event with Scouts from another member nation of the World Association\'. It also established the World Crest as one of the few PERMANENT patches or insignia on the Boy Scout or Scouter\'s uniform.\n\nNo matter how many \'international activities\' you took part in, you could only wear ONE per life of the Scout. Nor could you purchase a World Crest without a card (similar to the Eagle Scout card) which states that you are indeed the holder of the World Crest.\n\nThe crest became known as the \'Overseas\' patch of Scouting informally by Scouts and Scouters, because while a few were earned by Scouts and Scouters taking part in events in Canada or Mexico, many more...the majority...were earned by Scouts and Scouters serving as members of the Transatlantic (Europe, Near East, and North Africa), Far East (Far East, Japan, and the Phillipines), Canal Zone (Panama) and Direct Service (all other areas around the world) Councils. Scouts and Scouters in those Councils routinely had interactions with host-nation Scouting groups and many of those Scouts and Scouters developed lifelong associations with individuals and groups over the years, camping and doing social events with them and their members.

The BSA did something about this, in 1990, and changed the rules allowing for Scouts and Scouters in the USA to earn a World Crest by simply \'taking part in an international exhibit or display or an international event.\', whether or not Scouts from another country were present or not. Robert Zadima, the Council Executive of the Transatlantic Council and his Far East counterpart, along with some members of other US local councils, strongly made their objections known to the BSA\'s National Director of Operations and to the International Division, but those appeals fell on deaf ears, and the policy was changed.\n\nIn 1991, the BSA once again changed the policy over the objections of many local councils, whose volunteers and professionals had grown to respect the World Crest and what it stood for. The present policy is that the patch WILL BE WORN BY ALL YOUTH MEMBERS AND BY ALL ADULTS, VOLUNTEER OR PROFESSIONAL, AS A SIGN OF WORLD BROTHERHOOD AND UNITY WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SCOUTING COMMUNITY.\n\nIs there anything that has taken the place of the World Crest?\n\nIn order to earn the World Crest Badge before 1991, you must have participated in an international Scouting event or activity lasting five days or more.
